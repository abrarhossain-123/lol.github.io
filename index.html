                Hi Bby Red, <br>
                Happy 20th birthday to a real one! Sometimes I feel like we’re the same person in just 
                different bodies, same star sign,<br> close enough birthdays, like damn we were really 
                meant to be besties. You already know how much <br> I love you but I’ll tell you 
                again, I love you forever and always. Thank you for being the sunshine <br> on my rainy
                day or my shoulder to lean on when shit gets rough. I am always so grateful to have <br>
                you by my side and I cherish all the time we spent together. There ain’t nobody on this 
                world like you. <br>
                Love you again, and happy 20th birthday baby. Today the worlds revolves around you ❤️
                <br>

                    Happy 20th birthday, bby red! <br>
                    I’m so blessed to be beside you (in spirit b/c social distancing !!) as you 
                    welcome another decade of your <br> life. Thank you for constantly bringing your warmth, 
                    kindness, and loving nature into my life. Thank you <br> for feeding me Sour Patch Kids 
                    and for not getting mad when I spoil movies for you :( Who would’ve <br> thought that 
                    we’d be such close friends after physics with Mr. Tsai, but I guess what holds <br> 
                    us together is stronger than centrifugal force. You’re one of my favorite people in 
                    the entire planet, and <br> even if the world ends tomorrow 
                    (which it won’t, so please don’t overthink it !!) it’ll be okay because I  <br> met you. 
                    Here’s to another decade of laughter, dancing, and spoiling the endings. I 
                    can’t wait to <br> find more auras with you. <br> <br>
                    Lovingly yours, <br>
                    Bby yellow <br>
