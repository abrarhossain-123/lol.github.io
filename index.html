                    Happy 20th birthday, bby red! <br>
                    I’m so blessed to be beside you (in spirit b/c social distancing !!) as you 
                    welcome another decade of your <br> life. Thank you for constantly bringing your warmth, 
                    kindness, and loving nature into my life. Thank you <br> for feeding me Sour Patch Kids 
                    and for not getting mad when I spoil movies for you :(
                    Who would’ve <br> thought that we’d be such close friends after physics with Mr. Tsai, 
                    but I guess what holds <br> us together is stronger than centrifugal force. You’re one 
                    of my favorite people in the entire planet, and <br> even if the world ends tomorrow 
                    (which it won’t, so please don’t overthink it !!) it’ll be okay because I  <br> met you. 
                    Here’s to another decade of laughter, dancing, and spoiling the endings. I 
                    can’t wait to <br> find more auras with you. <br> <br>
                    Lovingly yours, <br>
                    Bby yellow <br>
